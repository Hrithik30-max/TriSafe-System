## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Architecture

### üß© Sensor-Microcontroller Wiring Diagram

The system architecture integrates multiple gas, motion, and thermal sensors with an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller, interfaced with **ESP8266** for wireless telemetry.

![Hardware Wiring](03d39b7e-bce1-4d63-bfd5-ed5ba56ffb6e.png)

**Sensors Integrated:**
- üß™ MQ2, MQ6, MQ135 (Gas detection)
- üå°Ô∏è DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)
- üìè Ultrasonic Sensor (Proximity)
- üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ADXL345 (Fall detection via acceleration)

Power is stabilized using LM2596 step-down converters. The ESP8266 relays sensor values to a cloud dashboard via UART communication.

## üß™ Dataset Summary

The project includes a synthetically generated dataset curated to simulate varied field scenarios faced by sanitation workers in hazardous environments. Sensor readings are mapped to:

- Gas concentrations (MQ2, MQ6, MQ135)
- Environmental vitals (Temperature, Humidity)
- Accelerometer data (X, Y, Z axes)
- Distance from ground (Ultrasonic)
- Labels: `fall_detected`, `toxic_gas_risk`, `anomaly_detected`

The dataset captures critical cases such as methane buildup, unconscious fall, and abnormal environmental changes ‚Äî making it suitable for training intelligent safety models.
